- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything I find on robotics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Robotics Projects of any kind.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Life.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: harsh[dot]mahesheka[dot]eee20[at]iitbhu[dot]ac[dot]in mail is the prefered way to contact me.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The term 'robot' comes from the Czech word 'Robota', that means 'Drudgery' or 'hard work' and 'forced labor'.
